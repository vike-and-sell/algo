## Local Setup

Follow these steps to get started with local development:

- Ensure that docker engine and docker-compose is installed.
- Rename .env.dist to .env and fill it with data
- Run docker-compose up --build

### NOTE

Every time a change is made you will have to hit CTRL + C to stop the docker-compose and then re-run docker-compose up to have the changes take effect.
